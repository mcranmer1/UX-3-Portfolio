    "string": "To me, design is a way of self-expression and every piece that I create, research, and explore is reflected in my work. I have always been drawn to design ever since I was little, doodling on the side of my homework, eager to get my hands dirty in art classes, and jumping at opportunities to learn something new. I have always felt a gravitational pull to this line of work and thrilled to have the ability to live out my dream. \r\n\r\nI was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska. Growing up in Alaska I grew to appreciate the beauty and serenity around me. The outdoors and my hometown inspired a lot of my work as a designer and often find my ideas to blossom when I am outside.\r\n\r\nAs a UX Designer I have researched how a person would be affected by design through prototyping, wire frames, and usability testing. Design cannot only be successful with how it looks, it is equally important to see how someone will interact and feel about your design. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are many faucets to a great designer I think the most important aspect is a passion for good interactive design that illicit a person to respond/react. \r\n\r\nIn the future I hope to create innovative design and provoke change/awareness to people viewing my work. I am a hard worker that strives to learn and absorb as much information as possible to improve myself as a designer. Are you with me?"
